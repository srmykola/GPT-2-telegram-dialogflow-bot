## GPT2-Telegram-Chatbot

GPT2 Telegram chatbot that's been relatively tuned for chatting. It could probably pass a turing test easily and I'd love for to get it turing test certified eventually. Feel free to make me PRs and I'll check out your code!

For a demo if it's online:
https://telegram.me/finishsentencebot

### Installation/How to use:

1. Install gpt-2 as normal IE:

```python3 -m pip install tensorflow```

or

```python3 -m pip install tensorflow-gpu```

...

```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```

2. Place this file in the src/ folder.

3. Install python-telegram-bot with 

```python3 -m pip install python-telegram-bot```

4. Input your telegram botfather bot key in the python file/

5. run: ```python3 src/GPT2-Learning.py```

If needed create a shell script that loops the bot python3 command in case of crashes. The bot requires atleast 8GB of free memory, (16GB preferred and a dual-core processor.) 

### For quick command reference:

```
start - Basic start command.
help - Show quick help command.
chatbot - Chatbot mode, me+you string edit and open-ended questions.
finish - Default finish sentence command counting words as output length.
learnon - Turn on sentence compilation with Me+you string for conversation.
learnoff - Turn off the sentnce compilation.
learnreset - Reset the learned conversation.
```

Here's a example without the learning mode, that will need more work in the future:

```
You're a smelly tiger plush! I need to give you a bath.
Computing...
I'm not a smelly tiger plush.
Reply:
Yes you are! Hurry up and get in the bathtub, the water is warm!
Computing...
I'm not going to the bathtub, I'm going to the kitchen.
Reply:
Hey! You better get back here!
Computing...
I'm not going anywhere!
Reply:
Then get in the bath tub!
Computing...
I'm not going to get in the bath.```
```
